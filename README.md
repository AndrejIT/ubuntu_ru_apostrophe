My russian phonetic apostrophe keyboard layout for Ubuntu

I am just used to Latvian lv(.') apostrophe keyboard variant, so i was not satified with any Russian keyboard layout Ubuntu was offering. So i created custom keyboard layout for my needs.

It is not easy to install: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Custom%20keyboard%20layout%20definitions
You need to place this file in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols and edit evdev.xml and evdev.lst files.
